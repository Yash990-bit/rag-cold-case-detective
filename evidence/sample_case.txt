Event Narrative:
A witness (identified as Sarah Jenkins) reported seeing a person in a large dark hoodie running away from the scene at approximately 9:15 PM. The witness stated the individual appeared to be carrying a small object, possibly a metallic case. 

The victim, identified as David Thorne, was found at 9:20 PM by a passerby walking their dog. Thorne was unresponsive and later pronounced dead at the scene. No weapon was recovered at the immediate site, although a single brass shell casing was found near the east entrance of the library.

Footage from a nearby security camera is being analyzed, but the lighting was poor. Preliminary review shows a vehicle matching the description of a silver sedan exiting the parking lot at high speed around 9:17 PM.
